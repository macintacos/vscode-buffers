# Contributing to `vscode-buffers`

If this project becomes serious in any way, a lot of things will be automated. Right now, I don't care enough, so I'm just writing down how I do things mostly for future reference.

## General Guidelines

- Use `pnpm` for installing dependencies and running scripts.
- Use `prettier` for formatting.
- Use ESLint for linting.

## Releasing

Run `pnpm run release` to cut a release. You'll need to make sure you follow the steps outlined here before running it: [Publishing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension)
